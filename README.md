# sony_xml_to_ale
Python script for converting a Sony Venice XML metdataset to an Avid ALE

You need to start the script in terminal via: python /your/path/SonyXMLtoALE_v01_1.py
or you type python into terminal and you dragdrop the script in the terminal

First you get prompted to point to a directory where your Sony Venice footage is and the 
script will search for the MPRO XMLs and will find automatically the clip XMLs.

It also looks if the clips defined in the XMLs are physically there.
